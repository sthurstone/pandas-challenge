PyCitySchool-Pandas_Challenge
______________________________

Completed in this repository you will find PyCitySchools project for section/week 4 homework: Pandas_Challenge, rather than 'Heroes of Pymoli.'

Through this challenge I was able to reflect on section/week 4 lessons and put to use the concepts. The most difficult part of this challenge was trying to get the second DataFrame to produce and display a chart - which unfortuntely, I was unsuccessful at (I keep getting one of two errors: 1) ValueError: array length 2 does not match index length 15
2) SyntaxError: unmatched ')'). I tried for hours and hours to debug this error but ran out of time. 

However, I was still able to reflect and analyis the data without the visual (though it would have been much easier to have had it). Some of the takeaways are as follow:
> The larger the school population the lower the overall grade average tended to be
> There are higher reading averages than math averages overall 
> Higher per_student_budget does not yeild higher grade averages
> Charter schools performed better than district (public) schools
